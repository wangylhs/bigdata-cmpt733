    "Causal inference is the process of drawing a conclusion about a causal connection based on the conditions of the occurrence of an effect. It is a very powerful and widely-used tool in real-world applications and scenarios. In this assignment, you are expected to apply the basic concepts of causal inference to solve problems on real datasets and be able to achieve the following goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand why causality is needed.\n",
    "* Understand what is causality, particularly the difference between causality and correlation.\n",
    "* Understand how to estimate counterfactual results.\n",
    "* Understand how to use the graphical model to represent causality.\n",
    "* Can use some tools (e.g., dowhy) to infer causality, express causality and estimate treatment effects."
