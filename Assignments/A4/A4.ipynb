    "The field of statistics is divided into two major parts: descriptive and inferential. In this assignment, we will cover two important topics in statistics: correlation analysis and bootstrapping, where the former belongs to the descriptive part and the latter belongs to the inferential part. After this assignment, you will be able to answer the following questions:\n",

    "1. How to visualize the relationship between two variables?  \n",
    "2. What is Pearson's correlation? How to compute it?\n",
    "3. What is Spearman's rank correlation? How to compute it?\n",
    "4. What's the difference between Pearson's correlation and Spearman's rank correlation? \n",
    "5. How to estimate a population parameter based on a sample?\n",
    "6. How to use the bootstrap to quantify the uncertainty of an estimated value?\n",
