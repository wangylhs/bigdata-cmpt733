    "Cloud computing is well known for a _pay-as-you-go_ model. That is, pay only for what you use. This model significantly reduces the cost of data storage and data processing, making big data techniques accessible to more and more people. Therefore, the company that you are going to work in the future is very likely to use EC2-like instances (on AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, or a private cloud) for data processing and use S3 for data storage.\n",
